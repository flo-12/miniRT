# miniRT

**Raytracing** is an old - yet still very common method - for rendering algorithms that generate digital images. 

The goal of this project was to implement a ray tracing algorithm in C! (more detailed instructions can be found in the subject.pdf in the section 'Mandatory Part'). 

The following images are generated by this program:

/// add amazing rendering images

## Learning goals
- Understand representations and transformations of 3d scenes in computer graphics.
- How to calculate the intersection(s) between vecotrs and objects (spheres, planes, cylinders).
- How to translate the above points into code
- And of course **how to collaborate** on a project and split workload in an efficient way!

Core features of this raytracer are:
- Render spheres, planes and cylinders with any orienation and position in space
- Have a variable viewpoint, view orientation as well as field of view
- Combining ambient, diffuse (maybe even specular) light sources with different colors
- (Using threads to render images faster)

# Usage
*Note that the program is written with Linux. Other operating systems were not tested.*

## Installing and Compiling
1) Clone the repository and its submodule by ``` git clone --recursive ... ```
2) direct to the cloned folder ```<folder_name>```
3) ```make``` (automatically compile the libft and MiniLibX)

*Check the MiniLibX ReadMe in case of problems with the library.*

## Execution
The proram will read the input for the scene from a file in .rt format. The scenes/valid/ folder contains some example scenes.
* Example: ```./miniRT ./scenes/valid/...rt```

## Scene Format
Rules for scene Format
Every scene must contain at least a **Viewpoint**:
- Identifier (C\); Coordinates (x,y,z) ; Orientation vector (x,y,z) ; Field of view (deg)

One ambient (A) and one or more diffuse (L) **Light sources**:
- Identifier (A); Intensity (0 to 1) Colors (r,g,b)
- Identifier (L); Coordinates (x,y,z) ; Intensity (0 to 1) Colors (r,g,b)

Additionally the Scene can contain **Objects** Sphere (sp), Plane (pl), Cylinder (cy) and Cone (co)
- Identifier (sp); Coordinates (x,y,z), Diameter (), Color (r,g,b)
- Identifier (pl); Coordinates (x,y,z -> any point on the plane); Orientation Vector (x,y,z -> orhtogonal to plane) Coolor (r,g,b)
- Identifier (cy); Coordinates (x,y,z -> on the center, bottom), Orientation Vector (x,y,z), Diameter, Height, Color (r,g,b)
- Identifier (co); Coordinates (x,y,z -> of the vertex), Orientation Vector (x,y,z), Opening angle (deg), Color (r,g,b)

Given the above rules we can define a Scene:
``` 
C   0,5,-15   0,0,1   80
A   0.2              90,90,255
L   0,6,-10     1     255,255,255


pl 1,-1.5,10        0,1,0 255,255,255
sp    9,0.0,0.0      3.6     0,255,0
cy    -7,1.5,0   1,0,0  4  6    0,255,255
co 3,7,0         0,-1,0  23   255,0,0

```
which renders to
![scene with cone sphere and cylinder](images/cyliner_cone_sphere.png)

// not necessary maybe ?
To enable colored diffuse light sources add .. to the environment variables
``` export ... ```

Realizing this project requires a deeper understanding of the raytracing algorithm as well as some literacy in linear algebra. The following list is a recommendation of sources for anyone who wants to know more about the topic:
